# Pandas / Jupyter Notebook


## Background
I was tasked with reviewing a city's school district data (test results). The goal is to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding the future school budget and priorities.
To complete the task I analyzed the standardized reading and math test results. I created tables to understand if the size of the school, the schools budget / budget per student, or school type (district or charter) had an significant impact on the outcome of the test scores.
